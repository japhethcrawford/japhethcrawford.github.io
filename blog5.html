    <p>Everything about this site seams considered. Especially the transitions from page to page. I've seen custom loading pages on various sites and would like to learn how they accomplish this without being resource excessive. I like how it implies that there is just one page that the user is just navigating through rather than to. I also enjoy their simplistic blog layout. That text explosion that happens when scrolling on the homepage (using parallax, I assume) is pretty neat.</p>

    <p>I'd really love to know how they incorporated the subtle click/tab sound with the hover action. Javascript? Also, how is that background animation happening? I can see that, for example, the first question with a baby has three separate images of the baby curled up, but how does the linear light sweeping/hue animation work as an overlay, and on a loop?</p>

    <p>I'd love to work more with svg animations like Lisa does here with the ferris wheel.</p>
