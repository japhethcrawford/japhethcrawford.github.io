    <p>I love all of the fluid motion used in this website. Especially the one rollover with a mouse and keyboard going into place with the computer shifting and increases in size. The custom loading screens (while they can get annoying if everything takes a second to load) are also pretty slick. When clicking on a project, I like how the project easily just pops open and closes without navigating through dozens of pages.</p>

    <p>This site take a user's smartphone orientation and decides whether it's a positive video/animation or sad video/animation being shown and ends up being a marketing campaign but the technology behind it is definitely interesting. All the user is required to do is to visit a url and enter a code that is provided when visiting the site on a desktop.</p>

    <p>Awesome way of showing what was accomplished at an office at a glance. I like how you can move around the canvas with your cursor and the video just pops up when clicking on an icon/badge. It's nice that the badge turns to a checkmark when it's been viewed. </p>
