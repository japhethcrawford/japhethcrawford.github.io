    <p>Not only does this show off some crazy capabilities of Google Glasses, but it shows it in a really interactive way. The landing page starts out with just a large background video, but eventually the viewer has to speak into the computer's microphone to tell "google glass" to do whatever it tells you to say.. which is sort of gimmicky but still kind of cool. I was most impressed with how the background video was constantly being controlled by scrolling. Scrolling up would reverse the video and scrolling down would advance it.
